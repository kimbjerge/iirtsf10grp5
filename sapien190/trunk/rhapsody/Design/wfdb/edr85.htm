<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Knowledge of respiratory patterns would be clinically useful in many
situations in which the ECG, but not respiration, is routinely
monitored. We describe a signal-processing technique which derives
respiratory waveforms from ordinary ECGs, permitting reliable
detection of respiratory efforts.  Central and mixed apnea, hypopnea,
and tachypnea may be identified with confidence.  In many cases,
obstructive apnea and changes in tidal volume are also clearly visible
in the ECG-derived respiratory signal (EDR).  We compare examples of
the EDR with conventional respiration measurements. In the context of
multiple-lead arrhythmia detectors, the additional computation
required for recovery of the EDR is insignificant.  The technique is
applicable to both real-time monitors and tape systems, requires no
supplementary transducers or hardware modifications, and yields
significant information of clinical value.

<h2>Relationships of cardiac and respiratory rhythms</h2>

<p>
The clinical significance of certain cardiac arrhythmias can be
understood only with reference to respiration.  The normal respiratory
cycle is accompanied by changes in autonomic tone which modulate heart
rate, causing sinus arrhythmia. Apnea may be associated with
tachycardia, increased ventricular ectopy, or asystole.  Stress,
congestive heart failure, and chronic lung disease may result in both
tachypnea and tachyarrhythmia. Thus, simultaneous observation of the
ECG and the respiratory cycle over long periods is often clinically
useful.

<h2>Respiration monitoring techniques</h2>

<p>
Methods of respiration monitoring fall into two categories.  Devices
such as spirometers and nasal thermocouples measure air flow into and
out of the lungs directly.  Respiration can also be monitored
indirectly, by measuring body volume changes; transthoracic inductance
and impedance plethysmographs, strain gauge measurement of thoracic
circumference, pneumatic respiration transducers, and whole-body
plethysmographs are examples of indirect techniques.  Each method has
unique advantages and disadvantages.  Direct measurements are the most
accurate, but interfere with normal respiration.  The whole-body
plethysmograph can be highly accurate and does not interfere with
respiration, but requires immobilizing the patient. Other techniques
require frequent recalibration but the transducers (belts or
electrodes) do not significantly burden a stationary patient; these
are the only methods suitable for ambulatory respiration monitoring.

<h2>Measurement of mean axis direction</h2>

<p>
ECGs recorded from the surface of the chest are influenced by motion
of the electrodes with respect to the heart, and by changes in the
electrical impedance of the thoracic cavity.  The expansion and
contraction of the chest which accompanies respiration results in
motion of chest electrodes. Short-term changes in thoracic impedance
reflect the filling and emptying of the lungs, a phenomenon which is
the basis of impedance plethysmography.

<p>
These physical influences of respiration result in amplitude
variations in the observed ECG (figure 1).  In terms of the equivalent
dipole model of cardiac electrical activity, respiration induces an
apparent modulation in the direction of the mean cardiac electrical
axis.  This phenomenon is independent of what is generally known as
electrode motion artifact, an intermittent and generally aperiodic
signal component which results from mechanical deformation of the
electrode/skin interface.

<p>
Several years ago, Pinciroli[1] began studying methods for determining
the direction of the axis, in order to create ``virtual ECG leads''
which would represent what might be obtained from electrodes fixed in
position relative to the heart.  We expected that fluctuations in axis
direction measurements would reflect the physical influences of
respiration on the ECG, and began a study to determine if these
measurements could be used to derive information about respiration.

<h2>ECG-derived respiratory signals</h2>

<p>
This relationship was confirmed by comparing axis direction
measurements with simultaneously recorded measurements of chest
circumference using a mercury strain gauge; later studies used
pneumatic respiration transducer (PRT) measurements. Axis direction
measurements based on chest electrodes correlate better with chest
circumference and impedance than with abdomen measurements, or with
direct measurements.

<p>
Although many techniques for measuring the direction of the axis work
well, we found that shown in figure 2 both accurate and
computationally simple.  After subtracting the baseline, the area of
each normal QRS complex in each of two leads is measured over a fixed
window (the width of which is determined during the learning phase of
the ECG analysis program to match the interval from the PQ junction to
the J-point of a normal QRS).  Area measurements such as these are
made routinely by many arrhythmia detectors, either for direct use in
feature-extraction approaches, or for normalization in
template-matching methods.  Since the window width is fixed, the area
is proportional to the mean amplitude of the signal, hence to the
projection of the mean cardiac electrical vector on the lead axis.
Assuming that the leads are orthogonal, the arctangent of the ratio of
the areas measured in the two leads gives the angle of the mean axis
with respect to one of the lead axes.  If the leads are not
orthogonal, a systematic but harmless error in axis direction
estimation results from this computationally convenient assumption.

<p>
Axis direction measurement during the QRS complex provides one sample
of the ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signal per cardiac cycle.  Given
that the heart rate is almost always greater than twice the
respiration rate, the frequency of respiratory effort can be measured
well from this limited set of samples.  Interpolation using cubic
splines produces a continuous EDR signal (figure 3) which bears a
remarkable resemblance to the signal obtained from a PRT chest
measurement.

<p>
If small numbers of ectopic beats are present, they may be
disregarded.  When many similar ectopic beats occur, a better strategy
is to make lead axis measurements for each morphology.  Measurements
for beats of different morphologies will generally differ by constant
angles which can be determined from the differences of the means of
the measurements for each morphology.  Once these constant correction
angles are known, measurements can be merged (figure 4).  If ectopic
beat morphologies are poorly differentiated (for example, if many
fusion PVCs are present), the distributions of ectopic beat
measurements will not match that for normal beats, and such
measurements should be discarded rather than allowing them to corrupt
the EDR.

</table></center>

<p>
Additional samples of the EDR can be obtained by measuring the mean
axis direction during the T-wave, which in general is not parallel to
that observed during the QRS complex.  T-wave axis measurements may
be merged into a stream of QRS axis measurements by adding a
correction angle as described above.  Calculation of the correction
angle should be made continuously in order to track ischemic changes,
which can rotate the T-wave axis relative to the QRS axis.

<p>
If only one ECG lead is available, QRS area measurements from that
lead can still be used in many cases as an approximation to the
respiratory signal, The single-lead EDR works best if the lead axis is
significantly different from the mean electrical axis, in order to
obtain a relatively large signal.  Since noise does not vary in
proportion to the signal, the greatest signal-to-noise ratio is
usually obtained when the lead axis is orthogonal to the mean
electrical axis.

<p>
EDR signals may be analyzed to determine the frequency of respiratory
effort by counting peaks which follow significant level changes.  The
normal range of respiration-induced axis shift is between 2 and 12
degrees, peak-to-peak.  The amplitude of the EDR from any given set
of electrodes is roughly proportional to respiratory tidal volume.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>
In order to evaluate the technique, and to explore its limitations,
simultaneous recordings of EDR and respiration signals were made in
the sleep laboratory at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.  Two roughly
orthogonal ECG chest leads, and chest and abdomen PRT signals, were
recorded for each of seven patients who were referred to the
laboratory with diagnosed or suspected sleep apneas.  Of this group,
obstructive apneas were recorded in four patients, including one who
also had mixed apneas; central apneas were observed in a fifth
patient, hypopneas in a sixth, and the seventh patient had normal
respiration.  Twenty-nine hours of recordings were analyzed using a
two-lead arrhythmia detector[2] which had been modified to calculate the
EDR.

<p>
Figure 5 shows a central apnea, as seen from the chest PRT and from
the EDR. The central apneas observed were easily identifiable in both
signals.

<p>
Figure 6 shows a rather remarkable event which begins with a 45-second
obstructive apnea (the beginning is not shown).  After nearly 35
seconds have passed, several sinus pauses occur, culminating in a 5.2
second asystole.  Shortly after the heartbeat resumes, a central apnea
begins, and persists for 15 seconds.  The figure shows a tidal volume
signal formed by combining the chest and abdomen PRT signals, and a
single-lead EDR (the second ECG lead was not recorded during this
event).  The obstructive apnea cannot be unambiguously diagnosed from
the single-lead EDR in this case, but the central apnea is quite
clear.

<p>
The arrhythmia in this case is the result of a respiratory
disturbance, and its clinical significance can be appreciated only if
this is known.  A cardiac pacemaker is not indicated on the basis of
this asystole.

<p>
Reliable detection of obstructive apneas using indirect techniques
requires both chest and abdominal measurements, since persistent
respiratory efforts during obstructive apneas are often
indistinguishable from normal respiration on the basis of a single
signal.  If both measurements are available, obstructive apneas are
indicated by out-of-phase signals ("paradoxical respiration"), which
cancel each other when added together if the instrument has been
calibrated properly.  Often the amplitude of each signal is
substantially lowered during obstructive apnea, and this
characteristic is shared by the EDR (figure 7).  Although some
episodes may not be detectable on the basis of the EDR, it appears
unlikely that chronic obstructive apnea could go unnoticed using this
technique.

<p>
Changes in respiration rate are easily detected (figure 8).  Artifact
can cause false peaks to appear in the EDR, however, and the best
strategy for interpreting an apparent sudden increase in rate is to
ignore it unless it persists for several cycles or reappears in the
same context.  Since the EDR is sparsely sampled, it night be thought
to be quite noise-sensitive.  In practice, although noise in the PRT
signal is sometimes visible in the EDR (figure 9), in many cases the
EDR is cleaner.

<p>
Examination of the MIT/BIH and AHA arrhythmia databases [3,4] showed
that signals qualitatively similar to respiration waveforms could be
recovered in all cases.  Since no independent respiration measurements
are available, the fidelity of the recovered signals cannot be
evaluated.

<p>
The technique has also been applied successfully to recordings made on
infants at risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  For these
infants, long-term respiratory monitoring for detection of central
apnea is of critical importance.  Derivation of a respiratory signal
from the ECG offers the possibility of reducing the number of
transducers needed for monitoring SIDS infants.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
Beat-by-beat measurements of mean cardiac electrical axis direction
relative to lead axis direction have been shown to be strongly
correlated with conventional measurements of respiration.  The
phenomenon has been observed in a wide variety of data.  The frequency
of respiratory efforts may be measured easily and accurately from the
ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal.  Respiratory disturbances which
are reflected in changes of respiration frequency are clearly
observable in the EDR.  Disturbances which are reflected only in tidal
volume changes, such as obstructive apneas, may not always be detected
using this method, although tidal volume changes are often visible in
the EDR.

<p>
The technique is computationally simple, and applicable to any type of
automated ECG analysis. It can be incorporated into real-time
arrhythmia monitors as well as tape scanning systems without the need
for additional transducers or hardware redesign.  Although the method
works best when two orthogonal ECG leads are available, it is possible
to generate an EDR from only one lead.  With an insignificant amount
of additional computation, any automated system for ECG analysis can
use this technique to produce significant, previously unavailable
information of clinical value.
