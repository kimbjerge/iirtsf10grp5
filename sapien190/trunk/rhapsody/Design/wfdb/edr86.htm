<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Respiratory signals may be derived from body surface ECGs by measuring
fluctuations in the mean cardiac electrical axis which accompany
respiration.  Two ongoing clinical studies illustrate the value of
the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) technique.  The first study
demonstrates the feasibility of using Holter recordings as a screening
test for sleep apnea.  In a sample of 9 patients, diagnoses based on
the EDR were confirmed by simultaneous polysomnography in all but one
case.  In the second study, Cheyne-Stokes respiration was observed in
a group of patients with severe congestive heart failure.  EDR
analysis showed that the phenomenon occurred in 8 patients out of 10
who were studied, and that its incidence decreased in 7 of these 8
after chronic oral administration of a positive inotropic agent.

<h2>The EDR</h2>

<p>
We have previously reported on signal processing techniques for
deriving respiratory signals from ordinary electrocardiograms [1],
based on the well-known observation that the body-surface ECG is
influenced by electrode motion relative to the heart and by changes in
thoracic electrical impedance as the lungs fill and empty.  It is
possible to measure a fluctuation in the mean cardiac electrical axis
(typically between 1&deg; and 12&deg; peak-to-peak) which is
well-correlated with respiration.  By interpolating between axis
measurements for each normal QRS, a continuous ECG- derived
respiration, or EDR, signal is obtained. Alternative methods have been
described by Pinciroli et al. [2]  and by Pallas-Areny et al. [3]  The lead
configurations routinely used in ambulatory ECG monitoring are
satisfactory for EDR processing, which is therefore applicable to
retrospective studies of conventional Holter recordings.  We have made
use of the EDR technique in two clinical studies at Boston's Beth
Israel Hospital (BIH).

<h2>Sleep apnea study</h2>

<p>
Polysomnography is the standard technique for diagnosis of sleep
apnea.  If it were possible to obtain an accurate diagnosis using the
EDR technique applied to Holter recordings, the advantages of this
method over polysomnography would be much lower cost and the ability
to perform the test in the patient's home.  We sought to establish the
diagnostic accuracy of an EDR-based test by performing it
simultaneously with the standard test and comparing the results.  For
the present study, Holter recordings were taken on 9 patients referred
to the sleep laboratory for possible sleep apnea. Simultaneous
polysomnography confirmed sleep apnea in 4 of these patients (group
1), and ruled out sleep apnea in the remaining 5 patients (group
2). An additional 5 Holter recordings (group 3) were drawn from recent
referrals to the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory, and these were selected to
match those in groups 1 and 2 in terms of age and cardiac rhythm.  The
patients in group 3 were considered unlikely to have sleep apnea.

<p>
The size of each group and the identity of the group to which each
patient belonged were concealed during the initial phases of the
study, during which we attempted to identify episodes of sleep apnea
on the basis or the EDR, using standard diagnostic criteria for
interpretation of conventional respiration signals.  Apnea was
therefore defined as cessation of breathing for at least 10
seconds. An EDR with an apnea index (the number of apneas per hour)
above 5 was considered ``suspicious''; otherwise it was considered
``normal''.  When the EDRs for all patients had been examined and
classified as either ``normal'' or ``suspicious'', the identities of the
patients were revealed and the following results were obtained:

<center><table>
<tr><th></th><th>Normal</th><th>Suspicious</th></tr>
<tr><th align=left>Group 1 (sleep apnea confirmed)</th>
<td align=center>1</td><td align=center>3</td></tr>
<tr><th align=left>Group 2 (sleep apnea ruled out)</th>
<td align=center>5</td><td align=center>0</td></tr>
<tr><th align=left>Group 3 (sleep apnea unlikely)</th>
<td align=center>5</td><td align=center>0</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>
Figure 1a illustrates the appearance of obstructive apnea in the EDR
signal of one of the correctly diagnosed patients in group 1.  The
misdiagnosed patient in group 1 had obstructive apnea which appeared
in most instances as a small amplitude decrease in the EDR (see figure
1b).  Modified criteria for diagnosis of obstructive apnea would
permit correct classification of this patient without loss of
specificity.

<p>
It should be noted that the diagnoses of patients in group 3 cannot be
verified, since simultaneous conventional respiration monitoring was
not available.  Overall, these results demonstrate the clinical value
of the EDR technique as a screening test for sleep apnea.

<h1>Study of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in CHF</h1>

<p>
The second study used data from a larger study on the effects of
milrinone on patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) [4].
Milrinone (Sterling-Winthrop) is an investigational positive inotropic
and vasodilating agent.  These characteristics may result in increased
cardiac output in these patients.  From a total of 72 such patients
who had received milrinone at BIH, we studied 5 (of 10) who survived
for at least 2 years after treatment began, and 5 (of 12) others who
died of progressive CHF within 5 months after treatment began, thus
selecting representative patients in the population with the best
and worst prognoses.  For each of the 10 selected patients, we
analyzed Holter recordings made shortly before and shortly after
administration of milrinone.  The total length of the EDR-processed
Holter recordings was 389 hours, of which 334 hours (86%) were of
adequate signal quality.

<p>
Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is common in CHF, but in most healthy
adults it occurs only at high altitude before acclimatization.  CSR
appears as alternating periods of deep breathing (hyperpnea) which is
usually sufficiently rapid to be classified as tachypnea, and shallow
breathing (hypopnea) or apnea, which can be detected easily from an
EDR (see figure 2).  The hypopneic or apneic phase is typically 50% to
90% as long as the hyperpneic phase, which lasts from 12 to 180
seconds; cycle lengths for CSR vary from 16 to 200 seconds [5].  It has been
suggested that prolonged circulation times, due to relatively low
cardiac output in CHF patients, delay the feedback between oxygenation
of blood in the lungs and stimulation of chemoreceptors in the
brainstem, resulting in the oscillations in respiratory amplitude
which are characteristic of CSR [6,7].

<p>
In unacclimated healthy adults at high altitude, Waggener et al. [8]
showed that CSR cycle length varies more between subjects than within
individuals, and found that, at 14000 feet (4267 m), the cycle
length varied on average by 6% between observations made three weeks
apart in the same subject. If a substantially greater change in cycle
length is observed without marked changes in environment or level of
physical activity, one may conjecture that a change has occurred in
the ability of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to meet the
demands imposed upon them.  One might therefore predict that in
patients for whom milrinone is effective, more rapid circulation
should result in a decrease in the amount of CSR, and a decrease in
its cycle length.

<p>
In the present study, the prevalence of CSR was 80%.  This high rate
reflects the severe degree of underlying cardiac decompensation in the
patients studied.  Only two patients (one survivor and one
non-survivor) did not experience CSR. Altogether, 102 episodes of CSR
were observed.  The mean duration of CSR episodes was 18.35 minutes
(range 1.6 minutes to 2.5 hours).  The mean CSR cycle length was 73
seconds (range 20 to 180 seconds).  CSR accounted for 14.0% of the
total analyzable EDR; in the 14 recordings in which CSR was observed,
the amount ranged from a low of 0.5% (in one of the survivors after
treatment) to a high of 47.3% (in one of the non-survivors before
treatment).

<p>
In 7 of the 8 patients who experienced CSR, we noted decreases in the
number of episodes per hour after chronic administration of milrinone;
CSR was observed in the eighth patient only after treatment (see
figure 3).  The total duration of CSR episodes decreased in 2
survivors and 3 non-survivors, but increased in another survivor and
another non-survivor.  Marked decreases in cycle length (greater than
40%) were observed in 2 survivors; in another survivor there was a
moderate increase (15%), and no cycle length changes were noted in the
remainder of the patients studied.  These results suggest that
milrinone is effective in reducing susceptibility to CSR, but without
implications for the clinical outcome,

<p>
We observed in these data that cyclic variations in heart rate often
accompany CSR, as reported previously by Goldberger et al. [9] In CHF,
such variations are often the only significant fluctuations in heart
rate, since respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is of very low
amplitude or entirely absent.  The striking differences between heart
rate spectra of a healthy individual and a CHF patient are reflected in
their EDR spectra (see figure 4).  Using information provided by the
EDR, it is possible to describe a heart rate spectrum concisely with a
three-component model, comprised of narrowband RSA- and CSR-related
terms superimposed on a wideband l/f term which may reflect the
responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to the variety of
environmental stimuli which impinge upon it.  Since the locations of
the CSR and RSA components can be determined from the EDR spectrum,
the EDR facilitates fitting this model to a heart rate spectrum and
reduces the uncertainty in the fit.  The effect of CHF on the heart
rate spectrum may be characterized as a loss of both the 1/f and RSA
components (reflecting the inability of the system, already driven to
its limits, to meet demands on it), coincident with the appearance
from time to time of a CSR-related component which is absent in the
normal spectrum.

arrhythmia (RSA) at 0.24 Hz in the heart rate spectrum at upper left,
matching the dominant peak in the EDR spectrum at lower left.  By
contrast, in the heart rate spectrum at upper right, the 1/f and RSA
components are diminished, and the dominant feature is a peak at 0.018
Hz, matching the Cheyne-Stokes peak in the EDR spectrum at lower

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
The clinical studies described above suggest the value of the EDR
technique.  In the first study, the EDR provided a new approach to
monitoring respiration for the purpose of identifying sleep apnea.
This approach is far less costly than studies requiring fully equipped
sleep laboratories, and may be more suitable for serial studies and
evaluation of therapy as well as for screening. In the second study,
the EDR increased the utility of an existing Holter database: it is
now possible to use a library of ECG recordings as a library of
respiration recordings.  Without the EDR technique, we would have no
information about respiratory patterns in these patients, because no
conventional long-term respiration recordings were made.  Having
obtained this information using the EDR, we have been able to study
the dynamics of Cheyne-Stokes breathing in CHF and its relationship to
heart rate variability.
