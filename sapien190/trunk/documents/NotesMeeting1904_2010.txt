Steps for design and analyses:

Analysis
	Domain model
	- Class diagram
	Application model
	- Control and boundary classes
	- Sequence diagram for UC #1
Design
	Design model 4+1 view
	See Sapien190SystemArkitekturDokument
	- Use case view - scenarious
	- Logical view - packages - UC realization
	- Process task view - 
	- Deployment view
	- Implementation view - components
	- Mechanistic design using design patterns

Actions:

Risk analysis
	To do On target
	1. Read wfdb files (Kim)
	2. Send content of wfdb files to analoge ports (Peter)
	3. Qt reading wfdb files on target (Anders)
	4. Integration of first demo reading wfdb files and sending contents
	to analoge ports while writing curve in Qt

Parallel - in Rhapsody 	
	- Domain model for UC #1 in Rahpsody (Kim)
	- Application model for UC #1 in Rahpsdoy - scenario (Kim)
	- Design 4+1 view see above


Design patterns that could be relevant:
	- State
	- Command
	- Memory Pool
	- Singelton
	- Obeserver
	- Smartpointers
	- Strategy
	- Two part architecture (discrete - continous)

Draft plan before 1. delivery 11. may:

1. week
	- Domain + application model (Kim)
	- Use Case senarious for #1 (Kim)
	- Reading wfdb on target sending data on port (Peter)
	- Qt running on target reading wfdb record and plotting (Anders)

2. week
	- Design model 4+1 view 
	- Qt prototype display wfdb records same time as data on port

3. week
	- Architecture document
	- Design implemented for first prototype
	1. delivery 11. may
 
Development methodology:
	- ROPES and UP
	- SCRUM?
