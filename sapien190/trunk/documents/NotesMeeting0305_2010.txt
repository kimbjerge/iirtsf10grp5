Peter:
	Done:
	- Reading about how to generate EDR signals
	Problems:
	- 
	Next:
	- Implemenent next in RecordWfdb for annotation and sample
	- Strip part to generate EDR from ECG signals ECGtoEDR
	- Serial port wrapper
	- Look at how to generate pulse from EDG annotation 

Anders:
	Done:
	- Draft state diagram for discrete part (Scenario, start stop ..)
	Problems:
	- 
	Next:
	- Look at contents for the Architecture document and contents based on theory
 		- Where to put Rhapsody diagrams in document
	- Start writing chapter 10 General Design Descisions
	- Design of the controller with command and state pattern and use inputs from Exercise1-5
	- GUI design and change of views based on the discrete model
	- Integrate Rhapsody model with GuI and FrameBuffer observer

Kim:	
	Done:
	- Meeting minutes
	- Devkit8000 for development
	- Continous model in Rhapsody look for patterns (Proxy, Pipes and filters)
	- Qt with Rhapsody and DAC on target (Qt, WfDB, Rhapsody, Dac, Abstract LinuxOS)
	- Look on how EDR works - how to used it in our system
	Problems:
	- 
	Next:
	- Update Rhapsody model with new design for continous part
	- Thread model - PatientModel and ConThread
	- FrameBuffer observer pattern
	- Test with loader for continous part and FrameBuffer observer
	- Generated and compile Sapien with Qt - test loader and starting of threads
		- To be completed friday and mail to Anders


Next scrum meeting monday at 11:30
	- Scrum status
