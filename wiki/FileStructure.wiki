=Rhapsody=
Only the basic project files and porject data base is included. The Rhapsody project is configured to output c++ files directly into the source file dir, "src"

=Eclipse=
The workspace does not contain all Eclipse's metadata. When a new project has been checked out, it will have to be imported into the Eclipse workspace.
Having the exercise/source/project/structure allows us to have several projects in each exercise.
